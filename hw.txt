Make the Islands run concurrently
	- each island should run in its own goroutine
	- each island should have a channel from which commands can be recieved from the search goroutine.
	- the quit command signal should be round trip

Currently the reporting is done asynchonously, by buffering the channels
Convert the reporting channels to the fanIn pattern and make them run synchonously, by removing the buffering of the channels

Add asyncronous migration to the islands
	This will involve adding channels between the islands
	you will also need to add incoming migrants to the general population
	hint: the underlying Expr member of Eqn has a Clone method

You will have to choose where and when communications happens
	hint: use (a) select statement(s), do you need a default case?


You will need to write a report describing your changes
please reference the relevant files and functions for each change

bonus points for reporting the correct results.
choose one equation for each data set.
note: it may not be the most accurate equation.
also it may not be reported by the program each time.
you should run each data set multiple times to obtain more conclusive results.
