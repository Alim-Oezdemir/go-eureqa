go-gpsr
=======

a Go library for Genetic Programming based Symbolic Regression

Genetic programming is a non-deterministic algorithm for uncovering
symbolic equations from data sets. GPSR is inspired by evolution.

This directory contains GP code with many enhancements. 

The code in this directory probably doesn't build as is.
